                <h2>Sherlyn Simic</h2>
                <p> Hi there, I’m Sherlyn. My mom gave birth to me on July 1st, 2004 
                    in the City of Manila.
                    I was raised here in Valenzuela City for 18 years already 
                    but we are originally from Tondo, Manila.
                    I’m the eldest child of my parents. 
                    I’m family-oriented and I have a strong relationship 
                    with my mom because she’s always spoiling me. 
                    I only have 1 sister and I’m asking 
                    for another but my parents don’t want anymore, kidding aside (HAHAHA).
                    I’m an outgoing person and I find myself an extrovert. 
                    I do have a sense of humor but sometimes it turns 
                    very corny and annoying (HAHAHA). 
                    I’m a very dramatic person maybe because of the 
                    influence of my favorite movie genre which is drama. 
                    I have long patience and it is proven and tested. 
                    You can easily make me laugh but not in funny videos 
                    because I find it corny most of the time.

            <p>I have loved doing art ever since I was a kid. I can make 
                different kinds of art such as painting, digital art, mandala, 
                layouts, and designs. I find art as my comfort zone every time 
                I feel sad or angry because this is my way of showing my feelings whether 
                I’m sad or happy. I can freely express my emotions with art. I also love 
                cooking and baking, especially for my loved ones. Sometimes I’m not good at 
                cooking but still, I love cooking because this is one of my ways of showing 
                my love by making food for my loved ones

            <p>I have a lot of favorite things and this is my top favorite 
            that I want to mention first, which is my love for the color pink.
            I’m super obsessed with this color because this makes me so extra happy. 
            My heart jumps in joy every time I see pink. I really love 
            sweet foods, especially cake, ice cream, and leche flan. 
            I love Filipino street foods such as 
            kwek-kwek, fishballs, calamares, turon, and halo halo.
